Webtalk is a new way to collaborate and showcase online for small businesses and freelancers. Think LinkedIn meets Dribbble.

The next version of Webtalk will leverage these Webtalk Business Pages to support product and service listings. With hopes to match users to product and service recommendations, we will select a new product to offer on user's NewFeeds each day. Webtalk data analysts have created a model that determines the probability that a user will act an offer, and this model is updated daily.

Therefore, each day we must produce a new value for each user.

Our Business Users are restricted to one offer each day, which may be matched with only one User.

Each day we will get the list of products/services that are eligible, and then we must decide which products to offer to which users.

Webtalk data scientists have produced the following algorithm to calculate the ValueScore ("VS") between a user and a product/service:

1. If the number of letters in the product/service name is even then the VS is the number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u, y) in the user's email* multiplied by 1.5.
2. If the number of letters in the product/service name is odd then the VS is the number of consonants in the user's email*.
3. If the number of letters in the product/service name shares any common factors (besides 1) with the number of letters in the user's email* then the VS is multiplied by 1.5.

*username, not including '@', domain or extension

Your assignment is to write a program that assigns each user with a product to be offered in a way that maximizes the combined total VS across all of the chosen offers.

### There may be a different number of products/services and users. ###

INPUT EXAMPLE:

Your program should accept a file path as its only argument. Each line will be one test case. Each test case will be a comma delimited set of user emails followed by a semicolon and then a comma delimited set of product/service names. Assume the input file is ASCII encoded.
